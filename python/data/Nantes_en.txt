The city is the [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants|sixth largest in France]], with a population of 320,732 in Nantes proper and a metropolitan area of nearly 1 million inhabitants (2020).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comparateur de territoire |url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=AAV2020-008+UU2020-44701+COM-44109 |access-date=31 July 2023 |publisher=[[INSEE]]}}</ref> With [[Saint-Nazaire]], a seaport on the Loire estuary, Nantes forms one of the main north-western French metropolitan agglomerations.

It is the administrative seat of the [[Loire-Atlantique]] [[Departments of France|department]] and the [[Pays de la Loire]] [[regions of France|region]], one of 18 regions of France. Nantes belongs historically and culturally to [[Brittany]], a former [[duchy]] and [[province]], and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial.

Nantes was identified during [[classical antiquity]] as a port on the Loire. It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] before it was conquered by the [[Bretons]] in 851. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century [[dukes of Brittany]], [[Rennes]] became the provincial capital after the 1532 [[union of Brittany and France]]. During the 17th century, after the establishment of the [[French colonial empire]], Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and [[role of Nantes in the slave trade|was responsible for nearly half]] of the 18th-century French [[Atlantic slave trade]]. The [[French Revolution]] resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). [[Deindustrialisation]] in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a [[service economy]].

In 2020, the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] ranked Nantes as a [[Global city|Gamma world city]]. It is the third-highest-ranking city in France, after [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gamma category includes cities such as [[Algiers]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Porto]], [[Turin]] and [[Leipzig]].{{sfn|Gawc - World}} Nantes has been praised for its [[quality of life]], and it received the [[European Green Capital Award]] in 2013.{{sfn|European Green Capital|2013}} The [[European Commission]] noted the city's efforts to reduce air pollution and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its [[biodiversity]], with {{convert|3366|ha}} of green space and several protected [[Natura 2000]] areas.{{sfn|Claire Iochum}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Confluence of Erdre and Loire, Nantes, France, 1890s.jpg|thumb|alt=Historical photochrom showing the confluence of the Erdre and the Loire|The confluence of the Erdre and the Loire (where Nantes was founded) in an 1890s [[photochrom]]. The river channels in the picture were diverted and filled in during the 1920s and subsequently replaced with roads.]]
Nantes is named after a tribe of [[Gaul]], the [[Namnetes]], who established a settlement between the end of the second century and the beginning of the first century BC on the north bank of the Loire near its [[wikt:confluence|confluence]] with the [[Erdre]]. The origin of the name ''Namnetes'' is uncertain, but is thought to come from the Gaulish root *''nant-'' 'river, stream'{{sfn|Delamarre|2003}} (from the pre-Celtic root ''*nanto'' 'valley'){{sfn|Vial|1983}} or from ''Amnites'', another tribal name possibly meaning 'men of the river'.{{sfn|Jean-Marie Cassagne and Mariola Korsak|2002|p=88}}

Its first recorded name was by the Greek writer [[Ptolemy]], who referred to the settlement as {{lang|grc|Κονδηούινκον}} ({{transliteration|grc|Kondēoúinkon}}) and {{lang|grc|Κονδιούινκον}} ({{transliteration|grc|Kondioúinkon}}){{efn-ua|See Ptolemy, ''Geography'', 214, 9.}}—which might be read as {{lang|grc|Κονδηούικον}} ({{transliteration|grc|Kondēoúikon}})—in his treatise, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''.{{sfn|Billy|1993}} The name was [[Latin]]ised during the [[Roman Gaul|Gallo-Roman period]] as {{lang|la|Condevincum}} (the most common form), {{lang|la|Condevicnum}},{{sfn|L. Pirault|1999|pp=10–19}} {{lang|la|Condivicnum}} and {{lang|la|Condivincum}}.{{sfn|Condivincum}} Although its origins are unclear, {{lang|la|Condevincum}} seems to be related to the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] word {{lang|xtg|condate}} 'confluence'.{{sfn|Deroy|Mulon|1992|pp=330b-331a}}

The Namnete root of the city's name was introduced at the end of the Roman period, when it became known as {{lang|la|Portus Namnetum}} "port of the Namnetes"{{sfn|Historique de la}} and {{lang|la|civitas Namnetum}} 'city of the Namnetes'.{{sfn|Deroy|Mulon|1992|pp=330b-331a}} Like other cities in the region (including [[Paris]]), its name was replaced during the fourth century with a [[Gauls|Gaulish]] one: [[Lutetia]] became [[Paris]] (city of the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]]), and Darioritum became [[Vannes]] (city of the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]]).{{sfn|Rostaing|1980}} Nantes's name continued to evolve, becoming {{lang|la|Nanetiæ}} and {{lang|la|Namnetis}} during the fifth century and Nantes after the sixth, via [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] (suppression of the middle syllable).{{sfn|Travers|1836|p=&4}}

===Modern pronunciation and nicknames===
''Nantes'' is pronounced {{IPA-fr|nɑ̃t|}}, and the city's inhabitants are known as ''Nantais'' {{IPA-fr|nɑ̃tɛ|}}. In [[Gallo language|Gallo]], the [[oïl language]] traditionally spoken in the region around Nantes, the city is spelled ''Naunnt'' or ''Nantt'' and pronounced identically to French, although northern speakers use a long {{IPAblink|ɑ|ɑ̃}}.{{sfn|Chubendret – Dictionnaire}} In [[Breton language|Breton]], Nantes is known as {{lang|br|Naoned}} or {{lang|br|an Naoned}},{{sfn|KerOfis}} the latter of which is less common and reflects the more-frequent use of articles in Breton [[wikt:toponym|toponyms]] than in French ones.{{sfn|Favereau|1997|p=27}}

Nantes's historical nickname was "Venice of the West" ({{Lang-fr|link=no|la Venise de l'Ouest}}), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|Cornet|1996|p=5}} The city is commonly known as {{lang|fr|la Cité des Ducs}} "the City of the [[List of rulers of Brittany|Dukes [of Brittany]]]" for its castle and former role as a ducal residence.{{sfn|Julie Postolec|2016}}

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Prehistory and antiquity===
[[File:Enceinte gallo-romaine Nantes detail.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo showing a section of the Roman wall in Nantes.|Section of the Roman city wall]]
The first inhabitants of what is now Nantes settled during the [[Bronze Age]], later than in the surrounding regions (which have [[Neolithic]] monuments absent from Nantes). Its first inhabitants were apparently attracted by small iron and [[tin]] deposits in the region's subsoil.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=17}} The area exported tin, mined in [[Abbaretz]] and [[Piriac-sur-Mer|Piriac]], as far as [[Ireland]].{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=9}} After about 1,000 years of trading, local industry appeared around 900 BC; remnants of [[Forge|smithies]] dated to the eighth and seventh centuries BC have been found in the city.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=10}} Nantes may have been the major Gaulish settlement of Corbilo, on the Loire estuary, which was mentioned by the Greek historians [[Strabo]] and [[Polybius]].{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=10}}

Its history from the seventh century to the Roman conquest in the first century BC is poorly documented, and there is no evidence of a city in the area before the reign of [[Tiberius]] in the first century AD.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=19}} During the [[Gaul]]ish period it was the capital of the [[Namnetes]] people, who were allied with the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]]{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=31}} in a territory extending to the northern bank of the Loire. Rivals in the area included the [[Pictones]], who controlled the area south of the Loire in the city of Ratiatum (present-day [[Rezé]]) until the end of the second century AD. Ratiatum, founded under [[Augustus]], developed more quickly than Nantes and was a major port in the region. Nantes began to grow when Ratiatum collapsed after the [[Germanic Wars|Germanic invasions]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=20}}

Because tradesmen favoured inland roads rather than Atlantic routes,{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=39}} Nantes never became a large city under Roman occupation. Although it lacked amenities such as a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]] or an [[Roman amphitheatre|amphitheatre]], the city had sewers, [[thermae|public baths]] and a temple dedicated to [[Mullo (god)|Mars Mullo]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=19}} After an attack by German tribes in 275, Nantes's inhabitants built a wall; this defense also became common in surrounding Gaulish towns.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=19}} The wall in Nantes, enclosing {{convert|16|ha}}, was one of the largest in Gaul.{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=41}}

[[Christianity]] was introduced during the third century. The first local [[martyr]]s ([[Donatian and Rogatian]]) were executed in 288–290,{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=43}} and a cathedral was built during the fourth century.{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=44}}{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=20}}

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Nantes - façade.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Nantes Cathedral|[[Nantes Cathedral]], rebuilt in the [[Gothic style]] beginning in the 15th century]]
Like much of the region, Nantes was part of the [[Roman Empire]] during the early Middle Ages. Although many parts of [[Brittany]] experienced significant Breton immigration (loosening ties to Rome), Nantes remained allied with the empire until its collapse in the fifth century.{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=47}} Around 490, the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]] captured the city (alongside eastern Brittany) from the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]] after a sixty-day siege;<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mathisen |first=Ralph W. |url=https://www.academia.edu/3624016 |title=The First Franco-Visigothic War and the Prelude to the Battle of Vouillé |journal=The Battle of Vouillé, 507 Ce |year=2012 |page=5 |language=en}}</ref> it was used as a stronghold against the [[Bretons]]. Under [[Charlemagne]] in the eighth century the town was the capital of the [[Marches of Neustria|Breton March]], a buffer zone protecting the [[Carolingian Empire]] from Breton invasion. The first governor of the Breton March was [[Roland]], whose feats were mythologized in the body of literature known as the [[Matter of France]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=25}} After Charlemagne's death in 814, Breton armies invaded the March and fought the Franks. [[Nominoe]] (a Breton) became the first duke of Brittany, seizing Nantes in 850. Discord marked the first decades of Breton rule in Nantes as Breton lords fought among themselves, making the city vulnerable to [[Viking]] incursions. The most spectacular Viking attack in Nantes occurred in 843, when Viking warriors killed the bishop but did not settle in the city at that time.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=25}} Nantes became part of the Viking realm in 919, but the Norse were expelled from the town in 937 by [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=26}}

[[Feudalism]] took hold in France during the 10th and 11th centuries, and Nantes was the seat of a [[county of Nantes|county]] founded in the ninth century. Until the beginning of the 13th century, it was the subject of succession crises which saw the town pass several times from the [[Duchy of Brittany|Dukes of Brittany]] to the counts of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] (of the [[House of Plantagenet]]).{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=27}} During the 14th century, Brittany experienced a [[War of the Breton Succession|war of succession]] which ended with the accession of the [[Montfort of Brittany|House of Montfort]] to the ducal throne. The Montforts, seeking emancipation from the [[suzerainty]] of the French kings, reinforced Breton institutions. They chose Nantes, the largest town in Brittany (with a population of over 10,000), as their main residence and made it the home of their council, their [[treasury]] and their [[chancery (medieval office)|chancery]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|pp=48–49}}{{sfn|Le Page|2014|pp=22–23}} Port traffic, insignificant during the [[Middle Ages]], became the city's main activity.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=26}} Nantes began to trade with foreign countries, exporting [[salt]] from [[Bourgneuf-en-Retz|Bourgneuf]],{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=26}} wine, fabrics and hemp (usually to the [[British Isles]]).{{sfn|Histoire du Port}} The 15th century is considered Nantes's first golden age.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=32}}{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=90}} The reign of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany|Francis II]] saw many improvements to a city in dire need of repair after the wars of succession and a series of storms and fires between 1387 and 1415. Many buildings were built or rebuilt (including the cathedral and the castle), and the [[University of Nantes]], the first in Brittany, was founded in 1460.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=31}}

===Modern era===
[[File:Nantes - Immeuble Perraudeau 01.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of 18th-buildings in Nantes|Typical 18th-century façades in Nantes]]
[[File:Nantes - Cours Cambronne 02.jpg|thumb|Cours Cambronne, a terrace developed at the end of the 18th century]]
The marriage of [[Anne of Brittany]] to [[Charles VIII of France]] in 1491 began the unification of France and Brittany which was ratified by [[Francis I of France]] in 1532. The union ended a long feudal conflict between France and Brittany, reasserting the king's suzerainty over the Bretons. In return for surrendering its independence, Brittany retained its privileges.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=49}} Although most Breton institutions were maintained, the unification favoured [[Rennes]] (the site of ducal coronations). Rennes received most legal and administrative institutions, and Nantes kept a financial role with its Chamber of Accounts.{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=46}} During the [[French Wars of Religion]] from 1562 to 1598, the city was a [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] stronghold. The [[Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur|Duke of Mercœur]], governor of Brittany, strongly opposed the succession of the Protestant [[Henry IV of France]] to the throne of France in 1589. The Duke created an independent government in Nantes, allying with Spain and pressing for independence from France. Despite initial successes with Spanish aid, in 1598 he submitted to Henry IV (who had by then converted to Catholicism); the [[Edict of Nantes]] (legalising [[Protestantism]] in France) was signed in the town, concluding the French wars of religion. Nonetheless, the town remained fervently Catholic (by contrast to nearby [[La Rochelle]]), and the local Protestant community did not number more than 1,000.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=56}}

Coastal navigation and the export of locally produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600.{{sfn|Histoire du Port}} During the mid-17th century, the [[siltation]] of local [[saltern]]s and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=58}} Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies ([[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Saint-Domingue]]) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after [[protectionism|protectionist]] reforms implemented by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market).{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=64}} In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, and it was the largest by 1700.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=59}} Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and [[Nantes slave trade|Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves]] in 1706.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=77}} The port was part of the [[triangular trade]]: ships went to [[West Africa]] to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods.{{sfn|Histoire du Port}} From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=92}}

Manufactured goods were more lucrative than raw materials during the 18th century. There were about fifteen sugar refineries in the city around 1750 and nine [[cotton mill]]s in 1786.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=84}} Nantes and its surrounding area were the main producers of French printed cotton fabric during the 18th century,{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=87}} and the [[Netherlands]] was the city's largest client for exotic goods.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=84}} Although trade brought wealth to Nantes, the city was confined by its walls; their removal during the 18th century allowed it to expand. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] squares and public buildings were constructed, and wealthy merchants built sumptuous ''[[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]''.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=85}}{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=50}}

===French Revolution===
[[File:Noyades Nantes.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a man and woman being dragged away|Painting of the 1793–1794 [[Drownings at Nantes]]]]
The [[French Revolution]] initially received some support in Nantes, a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] city rooted in private enterprise. On 18 July 1789, locals seized the [[Château des ducs de Bretagne|Castle of the Dukes of Brittany]] in an imitation of the [[storming of the Bastille]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=106}} Rural western France, Catholic and conservative, strongly opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the submission of the [[clergy]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=114}} A [[War in the Vendée|rebellion in the neighbouring Vendée]] began in 1793, quickly spreading to surrounding regions. Nantes was an important Republican garrison on the Loire en route to [[England]]. On 29 June 1793, 30,000 Royalist troops from Vendée attacked the city on their way to Normandy (where they hoped to receive British support). Twelve thousand Republican soldiers resisted and the [[Battle of Nantes]] resulted in the death of Royalist leader [[Jacques Cathelineau]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=115}} Three years later another Royalist leader, [[François de Charette]], was executed in Nantes.{{sfn|Chauveau|1993|p=150}}

After the Battle of Nantes, the [[National Convention]] (which had founded the [[First French Republic]]) decided to purge the city of its anti-revolutionary elements. Nantes was seen by the convention as a corrupt merchant city; the local elite was less supportive of the French Revolution, since its growing centralisation reduced their influence.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=106}} From October 1793 to February 1794, deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]] presided over a revolutionary tribunal notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness. Between 12,000 and 13,000 people (including women and children) were arrested, and 8,000 to 11,000 died of [[typhus]] or were executed by the [[guillotine]], shooting or drowning. The [[Drownings at Nantes]] were intended to kill large numbers of people simultaneously, and Carrier called the Loire "the national bathtub".{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=106}}

The French Revolution was disastrous for the local economy. The slave trade nearly disappeared because of the abolition of slavery and the independence of [[Saint-Domingue]], and Napoleon's [[Continental System|Continental Blockade]] decimated trade with other European countries. Nantes never fully recovered its 18th-century wealth; the port handled 43,242 tons of goods in 1807, down from 237,716 tons in 1790.{{sfn|Histoire du Port}}

==={{anchor|Industrial area}}Industries===
[[File:Nantes, La Loire et Le Pont Transbordeur en 1912.jpg|thumb|alt=1912 photo of the busy Nantes dock, with two large ships|The port of Nantes in 1912, with the demolished [[transporter bridge]] in the distance]]
Outlawed by the French Revolution, the slave trade re-established itself as Nantes's major source of income in the first decades of the 19th century.{{sfn|Histoire du Port}} It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, continuing it until about 1827.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=138}} The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=103}} Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a [[canning]] industry during the 1820s,{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=139}} but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from [[Réunion]] in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on Réunion sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=146}} By the mid-19th century, [[Le Havre]] and [[Marseille]] were the two main French ports; the former traded with [[Americas|America]] and the latter with [[Asia]]. They had embraced the [[Industrial Revolution]], thanks to [[Paris]]ian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the [[Tours–Saint-Nazaire railway]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=138}}

Nantes became a major industrial city during the second half of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city's two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the canning industry, included the biscuit manufacturer [[LU (biscuits)|LU]] and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=164}} Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in [[Saint-Nazaire]] had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be [[wikt:transhipped|transhipped]] before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=149}} Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a {{convert|15|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=109}}

==={{anchor|Nantes since the ''comblements''}}Land reclamation===
[[File:Nantes comblements.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Map of Nantes|Central Nantes in the first half of the 20th century. Waterways filled in from 1926 to 1946 are in brown, and buildings destroyed by American air raids in 1943 are in red.]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city's comfort and economic development. Sand siltation required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the [[Ile de Nantes|Isle of Nantes]].{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=188}}

When the [[land reclamation]] was almost complete, Nantes was shaken by the air raids of the [[Second World War]]. The city was captured by [[Nazi Germany]] on 18 June 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=391}} Forty-eight civilians were executed in Nantes in 1941 in retaliation for the assassination of German officer [[Karl Hotz]]. They are remembered as "the 50 hostages" because the Germans initially planned to kill 50 people.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=242}} British bombs first hit the city in August 1941 and May 1942. The main attacks occurred on 16 and 23 September 1943, when most of Nantes's industrial facilities and portions of the city centre and its surrounding area were destroyed by American bombs.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=188}} About 20,000 people were left homeless by the 1943 raids, and 70,000 subsequently left the city. Allied raids killed 1,732 people and destroyed 2,000 buildings in Nantes, leaving a further 6,000 buildings unusable.{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=393}} The Germans abandoned the city on 12 August 1944, and it was recaptured without a fight by the [[French Forces of the Interior]] and the U.S. Army.{{sfn|Il y a 70 ans}}

===Postwar===

The postwar years were a period of strikes and protests in Nantes. A strike organised by the city's 17,500 metallurgists during the summer of 1955 to protest salary disparities between [[Paris]] and the rest of France deeply impacted the French political scene, and their action was echoed in other cities.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=238}} Nantes saw other large strikes and demonstrations during the [[May 68|May 1968 events]], when marches drew about 20,000 people into the streets.{{sfn|Mai 68}} The [[1973–1975 recession|1970s global recession]] brought a large wave of [[deindustrialisation]] to France, and Nantes saw the closure of many factories and the city's shipyards.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=250}} The 1970s and 1980s were primarily a period of economic stagnation for Nantes. During the 1980s and 1990s its economy became service-oriented and it experienced economic growth under [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]], the city's mayor from 1989 to 2012. Under Ayrault's administration, Nantes used its quality of life to attract service firms. The city developed a rich cultural life, advertising itself as a creative place near the ocean. Institutions and facilities (such as its airport) were re-branded as "Nantes Atlantique" to highlight this proximity. Local authorities have commemorated the legacy of the slave trade, promoting dialogue with other cultures.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|pp=271–277}}

Nantes has been noted in recent years for its climate of social unrest, marked by frequent and often violent clashes between protesters and police. Tear gas is frequently deployed during protests.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 September 2018 |title=Une violence récurrente: enquête sur les manifestations à Nantes |url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/pays-de-la-loire/loire-atlantique/nantes/violence-recurrente-enquete-manifestations-nantes-1535732.html |publisher=France Info |language=fr}}</ref> The city has a significant [[Far-left politics|ultra-left]] radical scene, owing in part to the proximity of the [[ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 February 2014 |title=A Nantes, le centre-ville saccagé par l'ultra-gauche|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/archives/a-nantes-le-centre-ville-saccage-par-l-ultra-gauche-23-02-2014-3616799.php |website=Le Parisien |language=fr}}</ref> Masked rioters have repeatedly ransacked shops, offices and public transport infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 January 2022 |title=Nantes: une manifestation "antifa" dérape, les réactions pleuvent et une polémique enfle |url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/faits-divers-justice/nantes-une-manifestation-antifascisme-et-liberte-derape-les-reactions-politiques-pleuvent-1642850244 |publisher=France Bleu |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=17 September 2019 |title=Nantes, une ville blessée dans l'étau de la contestation |url=https://www.letemps.ch/monde/nantes-une-ville-blessee-letau-contestation |newspaper=Le Temps |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=8 December 2019 |title=Nantes: Le centre-ville se réveille groggy après les violences de Samedi |url=https://www.20minutes.fr/nantes/2669751-20191208-nantes-centre-ville-reveille-groggy-apres-violences-samedi |website=20 Minutes |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=23 April 2019 |title=Nantes: Il y a une "montée en puissance" de la violence", reconnait un policier |url=https://www.rtl.fr/actu/justice-faits-divers/nantes-il-y-a-une-montee-en-puissance-de-la-violence-reconnait-un-policier-7797483548 |publisher=RTL |language=fr}}</ref> The [[:fr: Affaire Steve Maia Caniço|death of Steve Maia Caniço]] in June 2019 has led to accusations of police brutality and cover-ups.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 August 2019 |title=Steve Maia Caniço rally: French police clashes erupt in Nantes |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49221066 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:Nantes SPOT 1247.jpg|thumb|alt=Satellite image of Nantes|Nantes as seen by [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]] in 2004]]
Nantes is in north-western France, near the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and {{convert|340|km|abbr=off}} south-west of [[Paris]]. [[Bordeaux]], the other major metropolis of western France, is {{convert|275|km|abbr=off}} south. Nantes and Bordeaux share positions at the mouth of an estuary, and Nantes is on the [[Loire]] estuary.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=12}}

The city is at a natural crossroads between the ocean in the west, the centre of France (towards [[Orléans]]) in the east, [[Brittany]] in the north and [[Vendée]] (on the way to Bordeaux) in the south.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=15}} It is an architectural junction; northern French houses with slate roofs are north of the Loire, and [[Mediterranean]] dwellings with low [[terracotta]] roofs dominate the south bank.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=14}}{{sfn|Bois|1977|p=9}} The Loire is also the northern limit of grape culture. Land north of Nantes is dominated by [[bocage]] and dedicated to [[polyculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], and the south is renowned for its [[Muscadet]] vineyards and market gardens.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=15}} The city is near the geographical centre of the [[land and water hemispheres|land hemisphere]], identified in 1945 by Samuel Boggs as near the main railway station (around {{coord|47|13|N|1|32|W}}).{{sfn|Boggs|1945|pp=345–355}}

===Hydrology===
[[File:Nantes - Erdre.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of the Erdre in Nantes|The Erdre (a tributary of the Loire), with the [[Tour Bretagne|Brittany Tower]] in the background]]
The Loire is about {{convert|1000|km|abbr=off}} long and its estuary, beginning in Nantes, is {{convert|60|km|abbr=off}} in length.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=15}} The river's bed and banks have changed considerably over a period of centuries. In Nantes the Loire had divided into a number of channels, creating a dozen islands and sand ridges. They facilitated crossing the river, contributing to the city's growth. Most of the islands were protected with [[levee]]s during the [[modern era]], and they disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s when the smallest waterways were filled in. The Loire in Nantes now has only two branches, one on either side of the Isle of Nantes.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=14}}

The river is [[Tidal river|tidal]] in the city, and tides are observed about {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} further east.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=15}} The tidal range can reach {{convert|6|m|abbr=off}} in Nantes, larger than at the mouth of the estuary.{{sfn|Les amplitudes de|2013}} This is the result of 20th-century dredging to make Nantes accessible by large ships; tides were originally much weaker. Nantes was at the point where the river current and the tides cancelled each other out, resulting in siltation and the formation of the original islands.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=7}}{{sfn|Rééquilibrage du lit}}{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=989}}

The city is at the confluence of two tributaries. The [[Erdre]] flows into the Loire from its north bank, and the [[Sèvre Nantaise]] flows into the Loire from its south bank. These two rivers initially provided natural links with the hinterland. When the channels of the Loire were filled, the Erdre was diverted in central Nantes and its confluence with the Loire was moved further east. The Erdre includes Versailles Island, which became a Japanese garden during the 1980s. It was created in the 19th century with fill from construction of the [[Nantes–Brest canal]].{{sfn|Corbé|2003|pp=26–28}}

===Geology===
[[File:Plan relief Nantes.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Map showing the elevation and rivers in Nantes|Elevation and hydrology map of Nantes]]
Nantes is built on the [[Armorican Massif]], a range of weathered mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching from the end of the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the [[Sedimentary basin|sedimentary]] [[Paris Basin]], are composed of several parallel ridges of [[Ordovician]] and [[Cadomian Orogeny|Cadomian]] rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays.{{sfn|M. Ters|J. Marchand|G. Weecksteen|1970}} The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark {{convert|38|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]; its [[foothills]] are at an elevation of {{convert|15|m|abbr=off}}.{{sfn|D. Janjou|avec collaboration de M. Gruet et C. Penecki|1998}}

The Sillon de Bretagne is composed of [[granite]]; the rest of the region is a series of low [[plateau]]s covered with [[silt]] and [[clay]], with [[mica]] [[schist]] and sediments found in lower areas. Much of the old town and all of the Isle of Nantes consist of backfill.{{sfn|M. Ters|J. Marchand|G. Weecksteen|1970}} Elevations in Nantes are generally higher in the western neighbourhoods on the Sillon, reaching {{convert|52|m|abbr=off}} in the north-west.{{sfn|D. Janjou|avec collaboration de M. Gruet et C. Penecki|1998}} The [[Erdre]] flows through a slate fault.{{sfn|Lelièvre|2000|p=14}} Eastern Nantes is flatter, with a few hills reaching {{convert|30|m|abbr=off}}.{{sfn|D. Janjou|avec collaboration de M. Gruet et C. Penecki|1998}} The city's lowest points, along the Loire, are {{convert|2|m|abbr=off|ft}} above sea level.{{sfn|D. Janjou|avec collaboration de M. Gruet et C. Penecki|1998}}

==={{anchor|Urban morphology}}Urban layout===
[[File:Boulevard de Launay (Nantes) 1.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of Boulevard de Launay|Boulevard de Launay, west of the city centre]]
Nantes's layout is typical of French towns and cities. It has a historical centre with old monuments, administrative buildings and small shops, surrounded by 19th-century [[faubourg]]s surrounded by newer suburban houses and [[Public housing in France|public housing]]. The city centre has a medieval core (corresponding to the former walled town) and 18th-century extensions running west and east. The northern extension, Marchix, was considered squalid and nearly disappeared during the 20th century. The old town did not extend south before the 19th century, since it would have meant building on the unsteady islands in the Loire.{{sfn|Plan local d'urbanisme|2007}}

The medieval core has narrow streets and a mixture of half-timbered buildings, more recent sandstone buildings, post-[[World War II]] reconstruction and modern redevelopment. It is primarily a student neighbourhood, with many bars and small shops. The eastern extension (behind [[Nantes Cathedral]]) was traditionally inhabited by the [[aristocracy]], and the larger western extension along the Loire was built for the [[bourgeoisie]]. It is Nantes's most-expensive area, with wide avenues, squares and ''[[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]''.{{sfn|Pierre Falga|2007}} The area was extended towards the Parc de Procé during the 19th century. The other faubourgs were built along the main boulevards and the plateaus, turning the valleys into parks.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=991}} Outside central Nantes several villages, including Chantenay, Doulon, L'Eraudière and Saint-Joseph-de-Porterie, were absorbed by urbanisation.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=83}}

[[File:Nantes 2005 7.jpg|thumb|alt=Apartment blocks photographed across the Erdre|Port-Boyer and the Erdre]]
After [[World War II]], several [[housing project]]s were built to accommodate Nantes's growing population. The oldest, Les Dervallières, was developed in 1956 and was followed by Bellevue in 1959 and Le Breil and Malakoff in 1971.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=83}} Once areas of poverty, they are experiencing regeneration since the 2000s.{{sfn|Julie Urbach|2016}} The northern outskirts of the city, along the [[Erdre]], include the main campus of the [[University of Nantes]] and other institutes of higher education. During the second half of the 20th century, Nantes expanded south into the [[Communes of France|communes]] of [[Rezé]], [[Vertou]] and [[Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire]] (across the Loire but near the city centre) and north-bank communes including [[Saint-Herblain]], [[Orvault]] and [[Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire]].{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=83}}

The {{convert|4.6|km2|adj=on}} Isle of Nantes is divided between former shipyards on the west, an old faubourg in its centre and modern housing estates on the east. Since the 2000s, it has been subject to the conversion of former industrial areas into office space, housing and leisure facilities. Local authorities intend to make it an extension of the city centre. Further development is also planned on the north bank along an axis linking the train station and the Loire.{{sfn|Plan local d'urbanisme|2007}}

===Parks and environment===
[[File:Jardin des plantes Nantes-serre.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of an old greenhouse in Nantes|A 19th-century greenhouse in the Jardin des Plantes]]
Nantes has 100 public parks, gardens and squares covering {{convert|218|ha|abbr=off}}.{{sfn|Les parcs et}} The oldest is the [[Jardin des plantes de Nantes|Jardin des Plantes]], a botanical garden created in 1807. It has a large collection of exotic plants, including a 200-year-old ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'' and the national collection of ''[[camellia]]''.{{sfn|Jardin des plantes}} Other large parks include the Parc de Procé, Parc du Grand Blottereau and Parc de la Gaudinière, the former gardens of country houses built outside the old town. Natural areas, an additional {{convert|180|ha|abbr=off}}, include the Petite Amazonie (a [[Natura 2000]] protected forest) and several woods, meadows and marshes. Green space (public and private) makes up 41 percent of Nantes's area.{{sfn|Les parcs et}}

The city adopted an ecological framework in 2007 to reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es and promote [[energy transition]].{{sfn|La qualité de|2014}} Nantes has three [[ecodistrict]]s (one on the Isle of Nantes, one near the train station and the third in the north-east of the city), which aim to provide affordable, ecological housing and counter [[urban sprawl]] by redeveloping neglected areas of the city.{{sfn|Les nouveaux quartiers|2010}}

==Governance==

===Local government===

[[File:Johanna Rolland, maire de Nantes..jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of the mayor of Nantes|Johanna Rolland, mayor of Nantes since 2014]]
Nantes is the {{Lang|fr|[[Prefectures in France|préfecture]]}} (capital city) of the [[Loire-Atlantique]] ''[[departments of France|département]]'' and the [[Pays de la Loire]] {{Lang|fr|[[regions of France|région]]}}. It is the residence of a {{Lang|fr|région}} and ''département'' ''prefect'', local representatives of the [[Government of France|French government]]. Nantes is also the meeting place of the {{Lang|fr|région}} and ''département'' councils, two elected political bodies.

The city is administered by a mayor and a council, elected every six years. The council has 65 councillors.{{sfn|Vos 65 élu-e-s}} It originated in 1410, when [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] created the Burghers's Council. The assembly was controlled by wealthy merchants and the Lord Lieutenant. After the union of Brittany and France, the burghers petitioned the French king to give them a city council which would enhance their freedom; their request was granted by [[Francis II of France|Francis II]] in 1559. The new council had a mayor, ten aldermen and a crown prosecutor. The first council was elected in 1565 with Nantes's first mayor, Geoffroy Drouet.{{sfn|Le pouvoir municipal}} The present city council is a result of the [[French Revolution]] and a 4 December 1789 act. The current [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Nantes is Johanna Rolland ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]), who was elected on 4 April 2014. The party has held a majority since 1983, and Nantes has become a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] stronghold.{{sfn|Antoine Gazeau|2013}}

Since 1995, Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods (''quartiers''), each with an advisory committee and administrative agents. City-council members are appointed to each ''quartier'' to consult with the local committees. The neighbourhood committees, existing primarily to facilitate dialogue between citizens and the local government, meet twice a year.{{sfn|Le dialogue citoyen}}

Like most [[communes of France|French municipalities]], Nantes is part of an [[communes in France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] structure which combines the city with 24 smaller, neighbouring communes. Called [[Nantes Métropole]], it encompasses the city's [[metropolitan area]] and had a population of 609,198 in 2013. Nantes Métropole administers urban planning, transport, public areas, waste disposal, energy, water, housing, higher education, economic development, employment and European topics.{{sfn|Les compétences de}} As a consequence, the city council's mandates are security, primary and secondary education, early childhood, social aid, culture, sport and health.{{sfn|Compétences de la}} Nantes Métropole, created in 1999, is administered by a council consisting of the 97 members of the local municipal councils. According to an act passed in 2014, beginning in 2020, the metropolitan council will be elected by the citizens of Nantes Métropole. The council is currently overseen by Rolland.{{sfn|Une organisation au}}

===Heraldry===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Nantes.svg|thumb|alt=See caption|Nantes's coat of arms]]
Local authorities began using official symbols in the 14th century, when the provost commissioned a seal on which the Duke of Brittany stood on a boat and protected Nantes with his sword. The present coat of arms was first used in 1514; its [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermines]] symbolise [[Brittany]], and its green waves suggest the Loire.{{sfn|Historique des armoiries}}

Nantes's coat of arms had ducal emblems before the French Revolution: the belt cord of the [[Order of the Ladies of the Cord|Order of the Cord]] (founded by [[Anne of Brittany]]) and the city's [[coronet]]. The coronet was replaced by a [[mural crown]] during the 18th century, and during the revolution a new emblem with a statue of [[Liberty (personification)|Liberty]] replaced the coat of arms. During Napoleon's rule the coat of arms returned, with bees (a symbol of his [[First French Empire|empire]]) added to the [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]]. The original coat of arms was readopted in 1816, and the [[Order of Liberation|Liberation Cross]] and the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945 (France)|1939–45 War Cross]] were added in 1948.{{sfn|Historique des armoiries}}

Before the revolution, Nantes's motto was "''Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine''" ("The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord", a line from a [[grace (prayer)|grace]]). It disappeared during the revolution, and the city adopted its current motto—"''Favet Neptunus eunti''" ("Neptune favours the traveller"){{sfn|Historique des armoiries}}—in 1816. Nantes's flag is derived from the naval [[Jack (flag)|jack]] flown by Breton vessels before the French Revolution. The flag has a white cross on a black one; its [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarters]] have Breton ermines except for the upper left, which has the city's coat of arms. The black and white crosses are historic symbols of Brittany and France, respectively.{{sfn|Drapeau de la}}

===Nantes and Brittany===
[[File:Château de Nantes - armoiries ducales.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a coat of arms on a castle wall|The arms of the dukes of Brittany in the [[Château des ducs de Bretagne|Castle of the Dukes of Brittany]]]]
Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique ''département'' were part of the historic province of [[Brittany]], and the city and [[Rennes]] were its traditional capitals. In the 1789 replacement of the historic [[provinces of France]], Brittany was divided among five ''[[départements]]''. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained.{{sfn|Reviews of Life}} Nantes and Rennes are in [[Upper Brittany]] (the [[Romance languages|Romance-speaking]] part of the region), and [[Lower Brittany]] in the west is traditionally [[Breton language|Breton-speaking]] and more [[Celts|Celtic]] in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany's economic capital and a cultural crossroads. Breton culture in Nantes is not necessarily characteristic of Lower Brittany's, although the city experienced substantial Lower Breton immigration during the 19th century.{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=71}}{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=76}}

In the mid-20th century, several French governments considered creating a new level of local government by combining ''départements'' into larger regions.{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=83}} The regions, established by acts of parliament in 1955 and 1972, loosely follow the pre-revolutionary divisions and Brittany was revived as [[Brittany (region)|Region Brittany]]. Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique ''département'' were not included, because each new region centred on one metropolis.{{sfn|Le Page|2014|pp=93-94}} Region Brittany was created around Rennes, similar in size to Nantes; the Loire-Atlantique ''département'' formed a new region with four other ''départements'', mainly portions of the old provinces of [[Duchy of Anjou|Anjou]], [[Maine (France)|Maine]] and [[Poitou]]. The new region was called [[Pays de la Loire]] ("Loire Countries") although it does not include most of the [[Loire Valley]]. It has often been said that the separation of Nantes from the rest of Brittany was decided by [[Vichy France]] during the [[Second World War]]. [[Philippe Pétain]] created a new Brittany without Nantes in 1941, but his region disappeared after the [[Liberation of France|liberation]].{{sfn|Alain Déniel|1976}}{{sfn|Bodineau|1995}}{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=95}}

Debate continues about Nantes's place in Brittany, with polls indicating a large majority in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring [[Reunification of Brittany|Breton reunification]].{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=124}} In a 2014 poll, 67 percent of Breton people and 77 percent of [[Loire-Atlantique]] residents favoured reunification.{{sfn|La réunification de|2015}} Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire officials, say that their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region.{{sfn|Bretagne: la bataille de la réunification}} Nantes's city council has acknowledged the fact that the city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is similar to that of the Pays de la Loire.{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=134}} City officials tend to consider Nantes an open metropolis with its own personality, independent of surrounding regions.{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=135}}

Nantes had 320,732 inhabitants in 2020, the largest population in its history.<ref name=pophist/> Although it was the largest city in Brittany during the [[Middle Ages]], it was smaller than three other north-western towns: [[Angers]], [[Tours]] and [[Caen]].{{sfn|Bairouch|Latou|Chèvre|1988|p=28}} Nantes has experienced consistent growth since the Middle Ages, except during the French Revolution and the reign of [[Napoleon I]] (when it experienced depopulation, primarily due to the [[Continental System]]).{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=797}} In 1500, the city had a population of around 14,000.{{sfn|Bairouch|Latou|Chèvre|1988|p=28}} Nantes's population increased to 25,000 in 1600 and to 80,000 in 1793.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=797}} In 1800 it was the sixth-largest French city, behind [[Paris]] (550,000), [[Lyon]], [[Marseilles]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Rouen]] (all 80,000 to 109,000).{{sfn|Bairouch|Latou|Chèvre|1988|p=28}} Population growth continued through the 19th century; although other European cities experienced increased growth due to industrialisation, in Nantes growth remained at its 18th-century pace.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=797}} Nantes reached the 100,000 mark about 1850, and 130,000 around 1900. In 1908 it annexed the neighbouring ''[[communes of France|communes]]'' of Doulon and Chantenay, gaining almost 30,000 inhabitants. Population growth was slower during the 20th century, remaining under 260,000 from the 1960s to the 2000s primarily because urban growth spread to surrounding ''communes''. Since 2000 the population of Nantes began to rise due to redevelopment,{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=798}} and its [[urban area]] has continued to experience population growth. The Nantes [[metropolitan area]] had a population of 907,995 in 2013, nearly doubling since the 1960s. Its population is projected to reach one million by 2030, based on the fertility rate.{{sfn|Lionel Kerdommarec|Patrick Pailloux|2011}}

The population of Nantes is younger than the national average, with 44.3 percent under age 29 (France 35.3 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 26.4 percent).<ref name=pophist/> Single-person households are 53.1 percent of the total, and 16.4 percent of households are families with children.<ref>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/7633961?sommaire=7634121&geo=COM-44109#ancre-FAM_T1 Couples - Familles - Ménages en 2020], INSEE</ref> Young couples with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from [[Paris]].{{sfn|Plan local d'urbanisme|2007}} In 2020, the unemployment rate was 10.5 percent of the active population (France 9.5 percent, Loire-Atlantique 7.9 percent).<ref name=emploi>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/7632005?geo=COM-44109 Population active, emploi et chômage au sens du recensement en 2020], INSEE</ref> The poorest [[public housing in France|council estate]]s had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent.{{sfn|Plan local d'urbanisme|2007}} Of those employed, 59.5 percent were in intermediate or management positions, 24.1 percent were employees and 11.4 percent were workers in 2020.<ref name=emploi/> In 2020, 39.7 percent of the population over 15 had a higher-education degree and 12.9 percent had no diploma.<ref>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/7633108?geo=COM-44109 Diplômes - Formation en 2020], INSEE</ref>

===Ethnicity and languages===
Nantes has long had ethnic minorities. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian communities were mentioned during the 16th century, and an Irish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] community appeared a century later. However, immigration has always been lower in Nantes than in other large French cities. The city's foreign population has been stable since 1990, half the average for other French cities of similar size.{{sfn|Plan local d'urbanisme|2007}} France does not have ethnic or religious categories in its census, but counts the number of people born in a foreign country. In 2013 this category had 24,949 people in Nantes, or 8.5 percent of the total population. The majority (60.8 percent) were 25 to 54 years old. Their primary countries of origin were Algeria (13.9 percent), Morocco (11.4 percent) and Tunisia (5.8 percent). Other African countries accounted for 24.9 percent, the European Union 15.6 percent, the rest of Europe 4.8 percent and Turkey 4.3 percent.{{sfn|Img1B}}

The city is part of the territory of the [[langues d'oïl]], a [[dialect continuum]] which stretches across northern France and includes standard French. The local dialect in Nantes is [[Gallo language|Gallo]], spoken by some in Upper Brittany. Nantes, as a large city, has been a stronghold of standard French. A local dialect (''parler nantais'') is sometimes mentioned by the press, but its existence is dubious and its vocabulary mainly the result of rural emigration.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=753}} As a result of 19th-century Lower Breton immigration, [[Breton language|Breton]] was once widely spoken in parts of Nantes.{{sfn|Le Page|2014|p=70}} Nantes signed the charter of the [[Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg|Public Office for the Breton Language]] in 2013. Since then, the city has supported its six bilingual schools and introduced bilingual signage.{{sfn|Nantes signe la|2013}}

==Economy==
[[File:Tereos Nantes.JPG|thumb|alt=Aerial photo of a sugar refinery in Nantes|Beghin-Say sugar refinery]]
For centuries, Nantes's economy was linked to the Loire and the Atlantic; the city had France's largest harbour in the 18th century.{{sfn|Decours|2006|p=59}} Food processing predominated during the [[Industrial Age]], with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories ([[Lefèvre-Utile|LU]] and [[BN (biscuit)|BN]]), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France's largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as [[Eurofins Scientific]].{{sfn|Industries agroalimentaires}}

Nantes experienced [[deindustrialisation]] after port activity in [[Saint-Nazaire]] largely ceased, culminating in the 1987 closure of the shipyards. At that time, the city attempted to attract service firms. Nantes capitalised on its culture and proximity to the sea to present itself as creative and modern. [[Capgemini]] (management consulting), [[SNCF]] (rail) and [[Bouygues Telecom]] opened large offices in the city, followed by smaller companies.{{sfn|Comment Nantes est|2015}} Since 2000 Nantes has developed a business district, Euronantes, with {{convert|500000|m2|abbr=unit|e6ft2}} of office space and 10,000 jobs.{{sfn|Euronantes, projet emblématique|2011}} Although its stock exchange was merged with that of Paris in 1990,{{sfn|Philippe Audureau}} Nantes is the third-largest [[financial centre]] in France after [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]].{{sfn|La deuxième place}}

[[File:Euronantes2.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerial photo of the Euronantes district|The Euronantes business district]]
The city has one of the best-performing economies in France, producing {{Euro|55 billion|link=yes}} annually; {{Euro|29 billion}} returns to the local economy.{{sfn|Quiriet|2016}} Nantes has over 25,000 businesses with 167,000 jobs,{{sfn|Économie}} and its metropolitan area has 42,000 firms and 328,000 jobs.{{sfn|L’Emploi dans la}} The city is one of France's most dynamic in job creation, with 19,000 jobs created in Nantes Métropole between 2007 and 2014 (outperforming larger cities such as [[Marseilles]], [[Lyon]] and [[Nice]]).{{sfn|L’Emploi dans la}} The [[communes of France|communes]] surrounding Nantes have industrial estates and retail parks, many along the region's ring road.

==Architecture==
[[File:Château des Ducs de Bretagne à Nantes.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of the castle gate|Main gate of the [[Château des ducs de Bretagne|Castle of the Dukes of Brittany]]]]
Nantes's cityscape is primarily recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century than in any other era.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=44}} The city has 127 buildings listed as ''[[Monument historique|monuments historiques]]'', the 19th-ranked French city.{{sfn|Monuments historiques à}} Most of the old buildings were made of [[tuffeau stone]] (a light, easily sculpted [[sandstone]] typical of the [[Loire Valley]]) and cheaper [[schist]]. Because of its sturdiness, [[granite]] was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.{{sfn|La ville rivulaire}}

Nantes has a few structures dating to [[Ancient history|antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]]. Remnants of the third-century Roman city wall exist in the old town.{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=651}} The Saint-Étienne chapel, in the Saint-Donatien cemetery outside the city centre, dates to 510 and was originally part of a Roman [[necropolis]].{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=652}} The Roman city walls were largely replaced during the 13th and 15th centuries. Although many of the walls were destroyed in the 18th century, some segments (such as Porte Saint-Pierre, built in 1478) survived.{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=682}}

[[File:Nantes - Beffroi Ste Croix 01.jpg|thumb|alt=Ornate church belfry against a blue sky|[[Belfry (architecture)|Belfry]] of Sainte-Croix Church]]
Several 15th- and 16th-century [[Half-timbering|half-timbered]] houses still stand in Le Bouffay, an ancient area corresponding to Nantes's medieval core{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=664}} which is bordered by [[Nantes Cathedral]] and the [[Château des ducs de Bretagne|Castle of the Dukes of Brittany]]. The large, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral replaced an earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church. Its construction took 457 years, from 1434 to 1891. The cathedral's tomb of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] and his wife is an example of French [[Renaissance sculpture]].{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=669}} The Psallette, built next to the cathedral about 1500, is a late-Gothic mansion.{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=682}} The Gothic castle is one of Nantes's chief landmarks. Begun in 1207, many of its current buildings date to the 15th century. Although the castle had a military role, it was also a residence for the ducal [[Court (royal)|court]]. Granite towers on the outside hide delicate tuffeau-stone ornaments on its inner facades, designed in [[Flamboyant]] style with [[Renaissance architecture|Italianate influence]].{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=656}} The [[Counter-Reformation]] inspired two [[baroque]] churches: the 1655 Oratory Chapel and Sainte-Croix Church, rebuilt in 1670. A municipal belfry clock (originally on a tower of Bouffay Castle, a prison demolished after the [[French Revolution]]) was added to the church in 1860. {{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=693}}

[[File:Nantes - Colonne Louis-XVI 04.jpg|thumb|alt=Large column with a statue of Louis XVI on top|Place Foch, with its [[Louis XVI]] column]]
After the [[Renaissance]], Nantes developed west of its medieval core along new embankments. Trade-derived wealth permitted the construction of many public monuments during the 18th century, most designed by the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architects Jean-Baptiste Ceineray and [[Mathurin Crucy]]. They include the Chamber of Accounts of Brittany (now the ''[[préfecture]]'', 1763–1783); the [[Théâtre Graslin|Graslin Theatre]] (1788); Place Foch, with its column and statue of [[Louis XVI]] (1790), and the [[Palais de la Bourse (Nantes)|stock exchange]] (1790–1815). Place Royale was completed in 1790, and the large fountain added in 1865. Its statues represent the city of Nantes, the Loire and its main tributaries. The city's 18th-century heritage is also reflected in the ''[[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]'' and other private buildings for the wealthy, such as the Cours Cambronne (inspired by [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[terraced house|terraces]]).{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=714}} Although many of the 18th-century buildings have a neoclassical design, they are adorned with sculpted [[rococo]] faces and balconies. This architecture has been called "Nantais [[baroque]]".{{sfn|Gilles Bienvenu|Françoise Lelièvre|1992|p=41}}

Most of Nantes's churches were rebuilt during the 19th century, a period of population growth and religious revival after the French Revolution. Most were rebuilt in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]], including the city's two basilicas: Saint-Nicolas and Saint-Donatien. The first, built between 1844 and 1869, was one of France's first Gothic Revival projects. The latter was built between 1881 and 1901, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (which triggered another Catholic revival in France). Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port, near the Loire, is an example of 19th-century neoclassicism. Built in 1852, its dome was inspired by that of [[Les Invalides]] in [[Paris]].{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=715}} The [[Passage Pommeraye]], built in 1840–1843, is a multi-storey shopping arcade typical of the mid-19th century.{{sfn|Le patrimoine des|1999|p=717}}

Industrial architecture includes several factories converted into leisure and business space, primarily on the [[Ile de Nantes|Isle of Nantes]]. The former [[Lefèvre-Utile]] factory is known for its Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by [[Jean Nouvel]] in 2000.{{sfn|Laissez-Vous conter Nantes}}{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|pp=48–49}}

=== Slavery Memorial ===
{{Main|Memorial to the Abolition of Slavery}}
A path along the [[Loire|Loire river]] banks, between the [[Anne of Brittany|Anne-de-Bretagne]] Bridge and the [[Victor Schœlcher|Victor-Schoelcher]] footbridge begins the Nantes slavery memorial. The path is covered in 2,000 spaced glass inserts, with 1,710 of them commemorating the names of slave ships and their port dates in Nantes. The other 290 inserts name ports in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and the area around the [[Indian Ocean]]. The path and surrounding 1.73-acre park lead to the under-the-docks part of the memorial which opens with a staircase, leading visitors underground closer to the water level of the river, which can be seen through the gaps between the support pillars. Upon entry, visitors are greeted with [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the word "freedom" written in 47 different languages from areas affected by the slave trade. Other etchings of quotes by figures like [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] appear on the slanted frosted glass wall which lined the memorial wall opposite the pillars which open to the river. These quotes come from across the globe, from all four continents affected by the slave trade, and span over five centuries, from the 17th to the 21st. At the end of the hall, toward the exit, is a room with the timeline of slavery as it became abolished in various countries around the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Discovery |url=http://memorial.nantes.fr/en/discovery/ |access-date=2018-12-12 |website=Mémorial de l'abolition de l'esclavage – Nantes |language=en-US}}</ref>

Nantes has been described as the birthplace of [[surrealism]], since [[André Breton]] (leader of the movement) met [[Jacques Vaché]] there in 1916.{{sfn|Pétré-Grenouilleau|2008|p=200}} In ''[[Nadja (novel)|Nadja]]'' (1928), André Breton called Nantes "perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I have the impression that something worthwhile may happen to me".{{sfn|J. H. Matthews|1986|p=52}} Fellow surrealist [[Julien Gracq]] wrote ''[[The Shape of a City]]'', published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired [[Stendhal]] (in his 1838 ''Mémoires d'un touriste''); [[Gustave Flaubert]] (in his 1881 ''Par les champs et par les grèves'', where he describes his journey through [[Brittany]]); [[Henry James]], in his 1884 ''[[A Little Tour in France]]''; [[André Pieyre de Mandiargues]] in ''Le Musée noir'' (1946), and [[Paul-Louis Rossi]] in ''Nantes'' (1987).{{sfn|Au fil des pages de "Nantes dans la littérature"}}

The city is the hometown of [[French New Wave]] film director [[Jacques Demy]]. Two of Demy's films were set and shot in Nantes: ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'' (1964) and ''[[Une chambre en ville|A Room in Town]]'' (1982). The [[Passage Pommeraye]] appears briefly in ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]''. Other films set (or filmed) in Nantes include ''[[God's Thunder]]'' by [[Denys de La Patellière]] (1965), ''[[The Married Couple of the Year Two]]'' by [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (1971), ''[[Day Off (film)|Day Off]]'' by [[Pascal Thomas]] (2001) and ''[[Black Venus (2010 film)|Black Venus]]'' by [[Abdellatif Kechiche]] (2010).

[[File:Affiche LU Bouisset.jpg|thumb|alt=LU advertisement, with a child eating a biscuit|1897 advertisement for the LU Petit-Beurre]]
During the 19th century Nantes-born [[gastronome]] [[Charles Monselet]] praised the "special character" of the local "plebeian" cuisine, which included [[buckwheat]] crepes, ''caillebotte'' [[fermented milk products|fermented milk]] and ''fouace'' [[brioche]].{{sfn|Qu'Est-Ce que la|2008}} The Nantes region is renowned in France for [[market garden]]s and is a major producer of [[valerianella locusta|corn salad]], [[leek]]s, [[radish]]es and [[carrot]]s.{{sfn|Cuisine et vin}} Nantes has a wine-growing region, the ''Vignoble nantais'', primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly [[Muscadet]] and ''Gros Plant'' (usually served with fish, [[langoustine]]s and [[oyster]]s).{{sfn|Le terroir nantais}}

Local fishing ports such as [[La Turballe]] and [[Le Croisic]] mainly offer [[shrimp]] and [[sardine]]s, and [[eel]]s, [[lamprey]]s, [[zander]] and [[northern pike]] are caught in the Loire.{{sfn|Qu'Est-Ce que la|2008}} Local vegetables and fish are widely available in the city's eighteen markets, including the Talensac covered market (Nantes's largest and best known). Although local restaurants tend to serve simple dishes made with fresh local products, exotic trends have influenced many chefs in recent years.{{sfn|Qu'Est-Ce que la|2008}}

''[[Beurre blanc]]'' is Nantes's most-famous local specialty. Made with Muscadet, it was invented around 1900 in [[Saint-Julien-de-Concelles]] (on the south bank of the Loire) and has become a popular accompaniment for fish.{{sfn|Qu'Est-Ce que la|2008}} Other specialties are the LU and BN biscuits, including the [[Petit-Beurre]] (produced since 1886), ''{{ill|berlingot|fr|Berlingot nantais}}'' (sweets made with flavoured melted sugar) and similar ''{{ill|rigolette|fr}}'' sweets with marmalade filling, ''[[gâteau nantais]]'' (a [[rum]] cake invented in 1820), ''{{ill|Curé nantais|fr|Le Curé Nantais}}'' and ''Mâchecoulais'' cheeses and ''[[fouace]]'', a star-shaped brioche served with new wine in autumn.{{sfn|Cuisine et vin}}

==Education==
[[File:Nantes Université-château Tertre.jpg|thumb|alt=Large building with a lawn in front|The Château du Tertre on the university campus]]
The [[University of Nantes]] was first founded in 1460 by [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]], but it failed to become a large institution during the [[Ancien Régime]]. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students had to go to [[Rennes]] and [[Angers]]. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city.{{sfn|Dictionnaire de Nantes|2013|p=988}} The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013–2014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000. This was lower than in nearby Rennes (64,000), and Nantes is the ninth-largest commune in France in its percentage of students.{{sfn|Atlas régional}} The university is part of the [[EPSCP]] Bretagne-Loire Université, which joins seven universities in western France to improve the region's academic and research potential.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In addition to the university, Nantes has a number of colleges and other institutes of higher education.

[[Nantes Atlantique Airport]] in [[Bouguenais]], {{convert|8|km|abbr=off|0}} south-west of the city centre, serves about 80 destinations in Europe (primarily in [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Greece]]) and connects airports in [[Africa]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Canada]].{{sfn|Liste des destinations}} Air traffic has increased from 2.6 million passengers in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2014, while its capacity has been estimated at 3.5 million passengers per year.{{sfn|Résultats d’activité des|2015}} A new [[Aéroport du Grand Ouest]] in [[Notre-Dame-des-Landes]], {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} north of Nantes, was projected from the 1970s, to create a hub serving north-western France. Its construction was however strongly opposed, primarily by [[green politics|green]] and [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] activists. The potential construction site was long occupied and the project became a political topic on the national scale. The French government eventually decided to renounce to the project in 2018.{{sfn|Marie Conquy|2012}}{{sfn|Pascal Perry|2016}}{{sfn|Rémi Barroux|2016}}

Public transport in Nantes is managed by [[Semitan]], also known as "Tan". One of the world's first [[horsebus]] transit systems was developed in the city in 1826. Nantes built its first [[Mekarski system|compressed-air]] tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes's disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams.{{sfn|Nantes - Tramways}} The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The [[Nantes tramway]] has three lines and a total of {{convert|43.5|km|abbr=off|0}} of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram.{{sfn|Les chiffres clés}} [[Navibus]], the [[Water taxi|river shuttle]], has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.{{sfn|Transport fluvial :|2015}}

Nantes has also developed a [[tram-train]] system, the [[Nantes tram-train]], which would allow suburban trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in [[Mulhouse]] (in eastern France) and [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]]. The city has two tram-train lines: Nantes-[[Clisson]] (southern) and Nantes-[[Châteaubriant]] (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains. The Bicloo [[bicycle-sharing system]] has 880 bicycles at 103 stations.{{sfn|Nantes: L'été radieux|2016}}
